Module 6 Challenge: Data Sourcing
Data Sourcing and Merging for Movie Recommendation System

Overview

This project involves preparing data for a movie recommendation system by extracting movie reviews from The New York Times API and movie details from The Movie Database (TMDB) API. The goal is to merge these datasets to create a comprehensive dataset that can be used for further analysis and recommendation.

Skills Used

API Integration: Extracted data from The New York Times and TMDB APIs using Python's requests library.

Data Cleaning and Transformation: Processed JSON data and normalized it into structured Pandas DataFrames.

Data Merging: Combined datasets from two different sources on a common key.
Data Export: Saved the final cleaned dataset into a CSV file for future use.

Analysis and Findings

Data Extraction:
Successfully retrieved 200 movie reviews containing "love" in the headline from The New York Times.
Extracted detailed movie information for each title from TMDB, including genres, languages, and production countries.

Data Cleaning:
Converted nested JSON structures into flat DataFrames.
Cleaned and formatted text data, ensuring consistency in genre, language, and country fields.

Merging and Export:
Merged the datasets on the movie title, creating a unified dataset with enriched movie details.
Exported the final dataset to a CSV file, ready for use in building recommendation models.

Key Insights

The integration of reviews and detailed movie information creates a rich dataset that can be utilized for various recommendation algorithms.

The combined dataset offers a comprehensive view of each movie, combining subjective reviews with objective metadata.

By successfully completing this project, I demonstrated proficiency in data sourcing, cleaning, and merging from multiple APIs, showcasing essential skills for data-driven projects in real-world scenarios.
